## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### Continued development

I want to keep learning how React works and how "real world React project works". I also want to improve in algorithm. My solution to check if a player won is working but it feels like it could be easily improved and cleaned.
